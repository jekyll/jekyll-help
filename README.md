# Getting Help with Jekyll

Welcome to the Help repo for Jekyll! This is our new central repository where you can ask questions about how to use Jekyll. It's mediated by passionate community members with extensive experience and kind hearts.

## How do I ask a question?

First thing you should always do is **search through the issues**. If an issue exists for your question already, you're good to go! If you have a **follow-up question**, post a comment! If you** can't find a related issue**:

1. Have some code that isn't working? Fork this repo, add your code to a feature branch, push up and create a pull request. Anyone who sees your PR can comment on your code: "Hey, you forgot a curly bracket here!"
2. Wondering how others have tackled a particular problem? Simply [file an issue describing your problem](https://github.com/jekyll/help/issues/new) and another member of the community will answer it. Be patient; answers may take a while. Be sure to spread the link to your question throughout your social network in order to get the best possible chance of having it answered.

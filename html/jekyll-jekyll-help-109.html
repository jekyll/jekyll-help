            <p>No doubt this has already been mentioned or suggested somewhere, so please feel free to direct me to that spot to contribute... </p>
<p>Quick questions/ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;m often on the lookout for news &amp; information (blog posts, articles, videos, etc.) about Jekyll and Jekyll-related projects (Prose.io, etc.), but there&#39;s no single &quot;feed&quot; of that information that I can subscribe to / check-in on from time-to-time</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I&#39;m NOT actively hunting for news &amp; information about Jekyll, I&#39;m occasionally producing news &amp; information that talks about Jekyll (or static site generators in general) and it would be great if there were a place to contribute that (e.g., <a href="http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/staticnewsapps/">http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/staticnewsapps/</a> )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;News&quot; section on the Jekyll site seems to just focus on releases. The &quot;Resources&quot; section might be the place, if pull requests are encouraged against it, but perhaps its best left as a curated &quot;best of&quot; resources list... </p>
<p>Thus, I&#39;m really asking about a less curated stream of what everyone is thinking and doing with Jekyll. Useful? Already underway? Best place for it?</p>
<p>Phillip. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>Phillip, - I&#39;ve just been reading some of your posts. Great stuff. </p>
<p>So I started something. I built this a while back, but did nothing with it, but seems like there is a need, as you point out, so I resurrected it this morning. It&#39;s not specific to Jekyll, because my view is that any of the static site generators are tools to be chosen for a job, but as I&#39;m a big Jekyll user, it will be a focus of coverage.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still much to be done, but I&#39;d love to hear what you guys think: <a href="http://www.thenewdynamic.com/">http://www.thenewdynamic.com/</a></p>

However, they&#39;ve not posted much recently, whereas many others have been posting really interesting articles about the features in newer version of Jekyll -- that&#39;s what I&#39;m keen to have a feed of. :)</p>

<p>I was thinking something more along the lines of: <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org/">http://planet.mozilla.org/</a>  You know, a &quot;river of news&quot; on a topic. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>So far the site that I put together has been more about the process of thinking about this than anything.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of something like Tumblr, which can be open to contributors and quick and easy to add a link, yet gives it a bit of curation that I think is needed. </p>
<p>Without curation there&#39;s a lot of potential noise, including, for instance all the other Jekyll stuff out there (Jekyll Island, Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hide), and all the blog posts like &quot;why [or how] I switched from Wordpress to Jekyll&quot; which have no value. The issue there is that I&#39;d like everything to be filterable and searchable on the site, and that would include site content as well as the Tumblr stream.</p>
<p>Of course, my conception is to not concentrate solely on Jekyll because, as you demonstrate on your series of posts, there&#39;s a lot going on in the &quot;static&quot; space. Jekyll would be a filterable item, so anyone interested in just that one would easily be able to just see that content.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>I hear you re: curation, but also have experienced when curation A) filters out relevant content and B) runs out of steam and the site dies a slow death.</p>
<p>The upside to a Planet, IMHO, is that it&#39;s unfiltered by default. Filtering on topic of the stream then gives the user the exact amount of precision they&#39;d like. </p>
<p>For example, I don&#39;t mind the &quot;I just migrated to Jekyll&quot; posts, because they point out new people coming into the Jekyll space and possibly solving new problems. </p>
<p>There&#39;s no issue with Jekyll and Hyde use case, because a planet is made up of narrow streams -- e.g., <a href="http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/jekyll/">http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/jekyll/</a>  -- and is not consuming a public search for &quot;Jekyll&quot; across various sources. </p>
<p>I hear you re: curation, but personally seek something less filtered and more real-time.</p>
<p>Keep the thought process going. Good stuff. :)</p>

<p>For me, they are quite different. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t often look to Twitter for information hash tagged with Jekyll.</p>
<p>I do however try to follow certain blogs that post on the topic. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Most Planets have two or three default filters: A) feed is already filtered by topic, e.g., domain.com/tag/topic.rss, B) feed item contains the term(s) specified, and C) feed is in some language (or filters out some language)</p>

<p>Great. :)  (Though I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following the difference between a River and a Planet that I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re trying to describe...?)</p>

<p>To my mind Planet means the universe of people who are talking about a topic and the river is the resulting stream of content from those people, likely filtered about a topic.</p>

<ol>
<li>Links to news/posts  (&quot;Jekyll Hook gets updated&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li>Links to resources (longer shelf-life than 1 above, includes tutorials, how-to posts, and other resources.</li>
<li>Perhaps a showcase</li>
<li>blog posts with my own or any contributor&#39;s observations.</li>
